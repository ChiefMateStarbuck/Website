Hello! I'm Samuel Septimus Guyah, current Senior at Florida Atlantic University studying Computer Science. This blog contains my thoughts on mathematics, literature, philosophy, tech, culture, personal journal entires,and generally any subject I find appealing to write about.

Most of my free time is spent with my girlfriend, at the gym, or on my machine learning side project.

You can reach me through my [email](mailto:sguyah2015@fau.edu) and my [Github](https://github.com/ChiefMateStarbuck).

Please enjoy!
