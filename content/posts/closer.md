I thought I knew a girl once. This was years ago. She was lovely when I first met her. Filled with joy and wonder and about things and life. We were young, high school friends that read too much and talked to loud about it. We were our own group of outcasts; ones that liked to enjoy listening to the echoing of dead men’s minds scratched down on print. To us, the voices were like sleigh bells bringing knowledge and forthcoming joy. They told us that if we were to work hard, things would surely get better; that if we strived for our goals, people from all walks of life would come to bring us joy beyond what we could ever imagined; but not without a great deal of sacrifice. 

We understood each other. We could hear each other in the silence and stillness of the day, or the wondrous upheaval that was the night. We were bonded by some unknown force that would not subside any length of cord that was tied one end around my neck, and the other end around hers. I should write her more often. But it seems that I try and I try and I try, but I don’t seem to get any closer to her. Maybe I’m thinking about her wrongly. Maybe we’ve hit a cycle of stagnation, and neither her nor I know of any way out. We seemed trapped by each other. 

My mind can’t do all the lifting. If we are going to keep talking the way that we do, our bodies must become one. For if not, I will give up on this perpetual nothingness that we find ourselves bound in.
