It's been 2 days since I wrote [Apathy_1](https://ssguyah.com/posts/apathy/). My stomach feels much better. I even went back to the gym yesterday and although I gave a lack luster performance, I'm happy enough that I even showed up.

I believe I might have found the source of my apathy towards my mundane world: it stems from my mundane work routine. Everyday I wake up and do the same few things: workout, go to school, study, hangout with friends/family/girlfriend
