As the new fall semester begins, so to does the yearly drudge and tiring exhalations of students and faculty heard through out the halls like background noise to a horror film. It is not pretty. The pursuit of pure knowledge, degrees,and ultimately a higher position in society were never designed to be an aesthetically pleasing journey. 

But this is fall. I am about to begin the final year of a four year journey and in a few short months, receive a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (hopefully with honors if nothing to dramatically terrible happens to my GPA) and begin my career in the tech field. I wanted to share some professional lessons I've learned as a student, a computer scientist, and a human being. Please enjoy. 

# A Student

There is something to say about the life of an engineering student that would put much people on edge. Classes including Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus, and multiple physics courses, are basic requirements for most engineering degrees. So, as an engineering student, you have willing signed up for the hardest courses offered at the undergraduate level. These courses can be daunting hurdles to overcome, but not impossible. 

Many people want to be engineering students for many reasons: some are sadist who enjoy the extraneous pain of never ending calculations, some have careers goals that require a great amount of quantitative skill, and others are simply here because they want to prove themselves to world. Whatever your reason, it's very important to keep this in mind throughout your university experience. This is your driving force as to why your putting yourself through such leaps and hurdles, taking classes that turn you from dunce to genius, and putting up with a workload that is unheard of in any other college in your university.

Whatever your underlining reason for doing something as bold and brash as becoming an engineering major, strive hard and long towards the end. Rage, rage straight into the light. 

# A Computer Scientist
 
As a student, especially one pursing a Bachelor's of Science rather than a Bachelor's of Arts, it's important to remember that there are hundreds of other people taking the exact same courses as you, and thus, doing the exact same assignments. Whether you plan to start a business, start a career, or start a graduate level degree, you're going to need to distinguish yourself from the pack. In the field of computer science, the best way to distinguish yourself is to be scientist no only for a grade but as a life style. 

A scientist, conducts extensive research, creates experiments, solves problems, optimizes, re-thinks old solutions, and replaces fear of the unknown with curiosity. When it comes to computers, there is no compromise on what it means to be a scientist. So when your mind is itching on a subject missing from your curriculum, you must put it on yourself to learn and master this new curiosity of yours. 

# A Human

Don't take it so seriously. 

That's the best advice I can give to as to not lose your mind. If the **student** part of your psyche is an uptight and studious prince/princess that accepts nothing else but the purest of logic and theory, and the **scientist** part of your psyche is a raging lunatic that spends hours in a lab doing unholy experiments, then the **human** part of your psyche is a smoke-totting hippy that just got back from burning man.

Life comes at us hard. You might fail a class or two. An experiment that you've put a lot of blood and sweat into might turn out to be for nothing. It's okay. These things happen. It's important to not take it too personally or too seriously. So do what ever makes you relax: hang with friends, eat good food, play lots of games, find a hobby outside of computers, go on dates. Just like you, I want to have a great impact on the world and society; I want my engineering to better the lives of not only me, but everyone around. But, in all honesty, it's not worth losing your mind over. 

Thank you. I hope you've enjoyed.
