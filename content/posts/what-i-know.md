As the new Fall semester begins, so to does the yearly drudge and tiring exhalations of students and faculty heard through out the halls like background noise to a horror film. It is not pretty; the pursuit of pure knowledge, degrees, and ultimately a higher position in society were never designed to be highly aesthetic.

But this is Fall. I am about to begin the final year of a four year journey and in a few short months, receive a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (hopefully with honors if nothing to dramatically terrible happens to my GPA) and begin my career in the tech field. I wanted to share some professional lessons I've learned as both a student and a computer scientist, and a human being. Please enjoy.
