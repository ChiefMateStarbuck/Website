As the new fall semester begins, so to does the yearly drudge and tiring exhalations of students and faculty heard through out the halls like background noise to a horror film. It is not pretty. The pursuit of pure knowledge, degrees, and ultimately a higher position in society were never designed to be aesthetically pleasing. 

But this is fall. I am about to begin the final year of a four year journey and in a few short months, receive a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (hopefully with honors if nothing to dramatically terrible happens to my GPA) and begin my career in the tech field. I wanted to share some professional lessons I've learned as a student, scientist, and human being. Please enjoy. 

# A Student

To put this as professionally as possible, the life of a student is ultimately filled with a ton of bullshit. This is not to say that the four years will be a complete waste of time, but a lot of it will be wasted. 
The hours students have wasted sitting in lecturers on material they could've learned in a compact YouTube video has been nothing sort of astounding, not to mention the hours wasted on the commute to these lectures.

Dont take it so seriously.
