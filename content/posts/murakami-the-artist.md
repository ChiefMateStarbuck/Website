It is a if every time I read one of his works I begin to catch myself, periodically through out the day, dreaming of nondescript facades of truly empty people living lives that question the very meaning of what it is to be a human being. His literature is paintings of life I never once experienced before; it casts me into an ocean of fear and serenity that I wish to never escape from. 

I am a fan. I truly am.
