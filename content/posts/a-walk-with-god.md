And as god fell one piece a time, through the ashed gray, he called out to the child for help. And for all the suffering that was given to the child, after all the lost loves that was burdened through his ever growing days, the child reached out and saved god from his own tragedies. And god grabbed back with ever growing force, reluctant to ever look into his savior’s eyes again. But the child kept his gaze. The child wanted to see god in his lowest form, so that when the child took the throne, he would rule differently them him. He would rule for all. Not for gods selected few that would rise and rid the world of the unwanted.

The child finally pulled his fallen master to his own level, and now walked beside him as an equal. The child’s eyes were filled with the fire of drive and hunger for a greater present. The child was no longer anyone’s to hold and to care for. The child, although keeping his name, was no longer a child. He was a greater being than he could ever imagine. 

He was not a child, a man, a god, or a beast. He was now the universe in its purest form. No longer would they walk with their head down. They had so much to fix, and so many ideas to spread. With each step the child took down this road the more they grew to see the pain as an ecstasy in all shapes and forms. Although the child wandered endlessly, they were always sure of their path. There were no wrong turns. There was only a clear path forward into the night, into that unforeseen darkness of self worth and divine thoughts. 

God, now relieved that his life of endless wandering was over was proud that their job was over. 

The child was to now find and create for themself. Nothing could stop them. He was going to conquer their whole dimension. It was clear to them now. Nothing could stop them. The child, from where he walked down the path of god could see all the corners of the space time and its branching platforms of existence. With each step there was a new understanding of things that were previously reluctant to show their form. 

The path was long and moving with many turns and obstacles, but the child accepted it all with opening arms, as god should have accepted the child.
