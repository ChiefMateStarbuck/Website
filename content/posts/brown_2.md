Long are the days of township solitude. But solitude held little connotation to the norm definition. Solitude meant that nobody around you knew who you were. People of all creeds still interacted with you because the density of the city forced people to be open and socially capable of the many endeavors  it took to know a stranger. With high respect and courtesy you would reciprocate the same social wellbeing onto the them. 

It also meant that you could wander and ponder as you pleased; although wandering and pondering could be seen as synonyms in the pursuit of self-understanding, and in that pursuit you could relate to the faces you saw all around you. Every expression they made seemed oddly familiar in your past selves. The hope of the young lovers on the metro, the calmness of the old and wise pondering about the world around them, the laughter of new friends enjoying each other’s company. I had learned a lot about myself just by pausing to think and ponder. 

Meditation had been a lost concept to me for quite a long period of my life. It was only when I had reached half-way across the world did it ever make sense to me as a method of relaxation. Now I write my meditations down and recap what I’ve been thinking about. It that way I can catch myself in my solitude slipping from the goal of becoming the greatest writer this side of the new millennium. In solitude is where a man crafts himself, I must face a lot of fine judgment in myself to become the greatest. And in that, I become my own best critic. Through meditation I have found these answers.

Yesterday I felt angry at the world. I cursed my oldest friend Greens to high hell and now I am certain we’re now set upon two different paths, him for a palace upon earth, and me in the pursuit of a palace among the stars. Yet, the only thing I can’t seem to figure out is this feeling I get every time I think about the end goal of my endeavor. 

A reluctant shock of fear mixed in with a heavy set of pride, almost as if I am not ready for the road ahead. And I’m not. I never was. But that shouldn’t matter now. Greens and I are through. And that’s well enough for me.

It was midnight in the city. The metro was closed so I had to take the long walk home. I lived about half a mile east of Républic, and from where I started the walk, it would take about half an hour. That was the good thing about Paris, after a while, when you’ve mapped it all out in your head – all the rue’s, the arrondissement’s, the small café’s with the same exact people in them at any point of the day – it was a breeze to find yourself around. And don’t believe the hype, Paris may be the city of lights, but the clearest ways homes sometime took you in dark places. 

I was drunk, I’ll admit. It seemed I was always drunk walking through the city, coming from some party down in Bastille or going to some club under the Seine. I was breathing in The Starry Night in real time, gasping at its profound state of existence. 

I walked and talked and pondered and wandered until home was in view. But that statement does not do the city justice. Paris was my home, every single inch of it; but now I was only steps – that were decreasing at a steady interval – away from my bed.
