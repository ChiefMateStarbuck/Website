What is it that drives me perilously into that void?

Is it the end goal of setting foot on a red god? I’ve dreamt of it a thousand times. I’ve seen my feet, in boots made of unbreakable material, dig the first human footstep deep into the planets surface. The red world and I would become one, as one trembles in awe of its first connection, so would the other, interconnected with the first breath we took. My second foot would now find its mark on the red world, yet a different awe would fill my body. The second bolstered the first, with two feet solidly on the ground I would now stand with a widen set, ready to take the mysterious red world with a now solid foundation. Two footprints, complimented by the barren wasteland that lay before me. With each action I now continued my life with knowing I would be the only man in existence to attempt what I am proceeding with. But is that why I want to go there?

Not for the glory, but for the self separation I would uptake from all my alien brothers? If I had accomplished that, my mind would begin to let go of all other societal constraints. My dreams and reality would bleed so finely together, and there would be nothing to stop me. I separate myself from mankind, I no longer have to compartmentalize my mind.

Take it slow. Take your time to figure these things out.
