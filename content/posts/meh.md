Is ignorance really bliss?  
Can ignorance be really what this is?  
How do define such abstractions  
If they can’t be seen as actions?  

I’m having a hard time changing.  
Guess that’s the main thing.  
A part of me wants to stay  
And slowly fade away.  

Use to call it a demon  
Now I’m dreamin.  
It was something I had to fight until I gave it all  
Now I’m questioning if I should just hang real tall  

But I got so much to live for,  
So much to do.  
Forgot that I was a big brother  
And I got nothing to lose  

So imma just go for it  
Take em all down.  
Forgot that life was lit    
And I had a good sound.  

So fuck death  
And all its cousins  
Cause till my last breath  
Imma unload dozens.
