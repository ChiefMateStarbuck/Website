Dealing with pain. God damn I was never any good at it. Pain was the enemy for the longest. I despised its presence and reaped nothing from it. They say that there are two kinds of pain, one that makes you stronger, and one that it useless. My mind has been scattered to the fucking wind. 

I woke up at 8:30pm today. This will be a long night; I have faced longer nights in the past though. And while this really doesn’t make any sense, or why the hell I went to sleep in the first place, I can presume I’ll be facing a lot of pain in the coming months.

He had finally got there. I had been waiting for 20 minutes for Greens to show up, when out from the corner of my eye I finally saw his signature blue jacket. He sat on my right side at the diner and ordered himself a coffee. 

“Sorry I’m late Brown. Just got out work. Try not to take my head off.”  
“You’re cool now. My waitress was keeping me entertained.”  
“So what did you call me all the way here to discuss?”  
After a long pause I spoke. “I'm sorry?”  

Greens took a deep sigh.

“Brown, you know how busy I am at the office. You know how important that is to me. You know I wish I could spend more time with the crew and all, but were growing older man. Things are changing. Outside of my work I only got you and Chelsea. There’s nothing I could do about it. That’s just who I am man. I’m not like you. I can’t spend my days doing nothing and feel decent about it. I can’t spend all night with absolute strangers and wake up the next morning feeling safe. That shit just ain’t for me no more. I work man. I got a kid on the way, I’ll be buying a house soon out the city, I just can’t run like I use too.”

Greens looked down at his coffee, looked back at me and continued to speak.

“We’re all dogs Brown. I’m just the dog that gave up on chasing every car that drove by. I mean, I’m a dog, what the fuck am I gonna do with a car?”

He stared at me for a while and finally looked down to his coffee. I began to laugh under my breath, and I exponentially got louder and louder until the whole diner gave me a glare.

“Greens. You know, you’re really something. You know that?”

Greens had the most puzzling look on his face, as if he was just given the task of writing an algorithm to plot Daedalus’ maze, then after perplexing over the issue of what in fact was really going on he finally spoke. “Are you insane?”

“In all honesty I’m not quite sure yet, though let me just get to my point. You’re a trip Greens you always have been.”

“What the fuck does that mean?” Greens said with a subtle wash of hostility. Long has it been since Green had felt the amusing scorn of Brown. Now, from out of a simple request from a friend and meeting that said request, Greens was about to receive a heavy dose of amusing rhetoric. 

“You are something Greens. Unequivocal and unmatched in dexterity. You are the eve to all things true and proud in this world and for that I put your soul next to the highest heavens above. You are my friend, a man; but to them you are a god. And how is it that someone like yourself has risen to such extreme power and grace? I will tell you how. You gave up on finding what it means to be alive, not for the people around you, but for your own soul. You have lost that sense of free will and expression of finding what it means to yearn for pain. You now live your life for men and women that could replace you in a year’s time; but that is not to put you down, no, or make you seem as an inferior lot to anyone or anything. In fact, quite the opposite. I only purpose the truth that the world moves on: always. When people find other people to fill their lives with, they exchange said people like toys and objects; when one breaks, it is abandoned and a new person is found to fill the void left by the previous. We all die Greens and living your life for the living is equivalent to living your life for the dead. No one can and will remember you when they’re dead. 
To live for your soul, and to let your soul guide you through the darkness and the uncertainty and the chaos, and to find at the other end, others who have found the light and lead their lives according not to the whims of others, but of the spiritual connection they found within themselves that now bind them to this earth forever, that is how a man should create a life. Not stuck at the office because the people he lives for pushes and binds him in that cage. And you my dear Green, are dexterous in the fact that you know in yourself that I’m right; because years ago, when we ran this town, and sat in this exact same diner, you gave me the same exact speech, and now you’ve flipped into something so profoundly opposite of your own past voice.”

Greens face was now only an inch away from mine. I had not realized that I was slowly getting closer and closer to his own. After I took a moment to search into his eyes of any remnants of the Brown I once knew, then accepting that there was nothing left of the Brown that gave me the exact same lecture I had just given him, I accepted our fate as old friends, and backed away from his face in remorse. I looked down at my coffee, payed my bill, stood up, and wished Greens a happy life. I walked out into the world with bleeding eyes and heavy losses. 

Dealing with pain. I could never take it as graciously as I wanted; I still had a lot to learn, about what it meant to be a man of your own will.
