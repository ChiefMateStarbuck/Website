<p>You have been blessed with an innate gift. One that is neither tangible nor visible, but is felt by all those around you. I believe in you, so please believe in yourself.</p>

<h1 id="the-plan">The Plan</h1>

<p>Life has been stable for the most part. I am on track to passing all my classes for the semester, my high GPA will be maintained, I am on track to graduating with a bachelors in Computer Science (On time if I might add. I followed the repetitive American Dream of beginning university right after high-school and graduating within 4 years flat. I will be 22 when I receive my diploma in May), I have a amazing co-op lined up for the spring with a top tech company (I will also almost certainly be offered a full-time position at the end of my internship), I plan on going to the NSBE National Conference in March to secure more job offers, my relationships with my family, friends, and girlfriend all seem to be quite healthy and stable, and all other things in my life are either too small to mention or to boring to worry about. Life is good. Granted, there have been many bumps along the way, but I am always able to correct my path, and sometimes the path of the ones around me. I should be satisfied. I should be happy. But I am not.</p>

<p>I am bored. I am unsatisfied. I am uninterested. I am lacking in motivation. I am lacking of supreme drive for my ambitions. I &ndash; more or less, and for lack of better words &ndash; am empty.</p>

<p>I &hellip; I don&rsquo;t really feel much for anything. <strong><em>I don&rsquo;t really care</em></strong>. I feel that it is useless, and by &ldquo;it&rdquo;, I mean everything.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t feel like myself; I am me, I know who I am. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve lost my personal confidence; I conquer everything I touch &hellip; almost everything. But, this overwhelming apathy I feel deep within all that I do, is an unshakable truth of the reality of my mind.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if everything I do doesn&rsquo;t matter. I feel stuck. I am very much desired by everyone around me &ndash; recruiters from the industry, friends, family &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t really feel the same for them because I don&rsquo;t really feel the same way about myself. I feel nothing. I am trivial. Everything I am or have done is for not.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ve been feeling like this. I don&rsquo;t know if this is all just because I ate some really bad food and have been throwing up for the past 24 hours. Maybe finding the root of this apathy will help me understand it better. I will be back when I have something.</p>
