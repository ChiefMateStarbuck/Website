<div class="tag-container"><span class="tag"><a href="https://ssguyah.com/tags/love">love</a></span><span class="tag"><a href="https://ssguyah.com/tags/loss">loss</a></span></div><hr/><p>I believe that love, in its most basic form, can be described as such: a want and desire to be physically, mentally, or spiritually close to something or someone and that this said want and desire is unconstrained by the wants and rules that govern survival. The life choices that are made in the pursuit of love, exponentially reduces your chance of survival in this world. That’s really the basics of a definition that I could give you. And once you’ve heard all my examples of misshaped love, then you’ll see that I’m really dying for nothing.</p>

<p>In the current of my now recently realized extremely brief love affair with Cat, I’ve realized now that I know absolutely nothing about the realm of women and their desires; I was arrogant to think I knew anything to begin with. One moment, we’re in love; exploring each other fully and openly, sharing more than our fair share of secrets and affections; she’d breath into my ear her sweet caressive moans, as if my body to hers was bringing the height of ecstasy in every corner in her mind; Aphrodite herself would’ve been so wet to hear her scream my name at climax. And the next, when all of the love has simmered, there was nothing between us anymore. No love, compassion, kindness. She wanted nothing to do to me and I wanted nothing to do with her. I admit it. I loved her, then I lost her.</p>

<p>My mind sometimes drifts back. She still lingered in my heart. A piece of me never wanted me to let go.  But now I feel absolutely nothing for her. Absolutely nothing. How dumb was I: to let her in my home, in my heart. She was a women looking for love, she had options that weren’t me, I should’ve known better. She gets no more of my time. She is now just a lesson.</p>
