    <p>WRITTEN ON Thursday, January 8th 2017 10:48pm</p>

<p>A certain grimy existence lives on the dirt of olds cars and foggy morning skies. An impure and grotesque air lives in the morning that I now find to be the bane of my very existence, and will probably be the reason this semester is not the proud and upright semester I’d like it to be. In all honesty, because of the morning beams that begin to — but never fully —  warm my body, to the depressing colors of a house in the rising sun, to all around sluggish sense of movement in ones body, mornings are the absolute fucking worst time of the day.
Never look in the face of your neighbors in the morning. There you will see the sadness of the everyday rat race that most men bind themselves too. Vulgar displays of grumpy mouths and adherence to the simple prose of always spitting on everything beautiful in the world seems to be the only thing men truly abide by in the morning; all other laws seem to vanish with the mystery and loving peace of the night.</p>

<p>The only thing I couldn’t hate that morning was the thought of K. But in sad distain for the situation I find myself in, she was nowhere around, and so my hate and – more importantly – disdain for every single entity, living or inanimate, grew with the sweltering sun across the low horizon; Not in the least attempting to warm the planet up. (Fuck u sun. It was cold as fuck today)</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>
