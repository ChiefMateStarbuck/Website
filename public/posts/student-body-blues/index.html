    <p>Before I begin, please do not misinterpret me: I do not care for the life of every individual that comprises the Florida Atlantic Student body. To be very clear, when I look around me and see only dilapidated and demotivated faces, my first thought is not to help every single one I see, but to analyze why they feel the way they do and to avoid the cause of their suffering at all costs. Whether the loathing they feel is self-inflicted or whether the cause is a mental loop of which they&rsquo;ve found themselves trapped in, it is best to understand happiness and sadness, success and failure, to best understand how to steer clear of all holes and downfalls; and (possibly), to help them understand how to get better.</p>

<p>Firstly, why the fuck are they so sad? I&rsquo;ve seen happier faces in the slums of Jamaica,then I have seen at an FAU football game (granted we lose every game but that is beside the point). It is not that they’re starving or short of any basic living expenditures for Boca is one of the most affluent cites in the country; I’m sure if they have found some way to finance their tuition, they&rsquo;ve must already figured out living and eating expenses.</p>

<p>It could indefinitely be something physical causing this livable sadness my peers have found themselves in, as in a mental disorder or a shortage of human resources (i.e. friends or physical affection). It also could be I mistake their stoic countenance as sadness, as I have never really had a bustling trouble with school, or growing up in general, and have actual found joy in the whole experience; the only time I see most of these is either in class or around campus. I cannot say for certain if they just depressed at school and not lively and adventurous people from the moment they step off campus and into the great blue, but I digress.</p>

<p>All I can really say is that while my peers on campus, they are the saddest bunch I have seen in a long time. So, it could be a problem with my peers relationship to college as a whole. I understand most of my peers are not having an easy time at college, what with all the homework and tests that never seems to end or that the amount of debt collected gaining a bachelor&rsquo;s seems to outweigh the bachelors itself, and my apparent happiness with how things are progressing can sometimes become a nuisance to even the most veteran of students. Or, it could be, my peers are just afraid of being happy, since they follow and mirror the faces of other peers so intoxicatingly.</p>

<p>But for whatever the reason is for my peers sheer lack of will, motivation, determination, gut, grit, and work ethic, it seems I haven&rsquo;t yet fallen into any of the major traps that create university blues in the mind. But that doesn’t mean that I’m any perfect. I still have a long way to go when it comes to all these things my peers lack. I believe that I lack with them the mental tools needed to grind the mind constantly until an elating finish is reached; a finish that might mean reaching one of my many goals of life, as in finishing my world travels, (possibly) getting a PhD, and starting a business. All these things and more I will work for in this world and I will first need to gain much more drive in my own life. Although I may not be able to boil down the exact reason a whole student body looks like Eryore, I can learn from them, learn to mentally  excel them, and to possible not only realize my own dreams, but help my classmates realize their own.</p>
