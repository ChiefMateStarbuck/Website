      <description>Dealing with pain. God damn I was never any good at it. Pain was the enemy for the longest. I despised its presence and reaped nothing from it. They say that there are two kinds of pain, one that makes you stronger, and one that it useless. My mind has been scattered to the fucking wind.
I woke up at 8:30pm today. This will be a long night; I have faced longer nights in the past though.</description>
