      <description>I held tightly to the belief that I would one day be a god. I awaited for it, praised its coming, even went so far as to dream for it. I realize now that it is a curse, and a great sadness arises from its coming.
I am glad that I am only human. I am glad that my days are numbered because it makes every day count more; it puts an energy into all that I do for I know that nothing is infinite.</description>
