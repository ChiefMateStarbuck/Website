      <description>I thought I knew a girl once. This was years ago. She was lovely when I first met her. Filled with joy and wonder and about things and life. We were young, high school friends that read too much and talked to loud about it. We were our own group of outcasts; ones that liked to enjoy listening to the echoing of dead menâ€™s minds scratched down on print. To us, the voices were like sleigh bells bringing knowledge and forthcoming joy.</description>
