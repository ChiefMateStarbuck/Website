      <description>I thought I knew a girl once. This was years ago. She was lovely when I first met her. Filled with joy and wonder and about things and life. We were young, high school friends that read too much and talked to loud about it. We were our own group of outcasts; ones that liked to enjoy listening to the echoing of dead men’s minds scratched down on print. To us, the voices were like sleigh bells bringing knowledge and forthcoming joy.</description>

      <description>I believe that love, in its most basic form, can be described as such: a want and desire to be physically, mentally, or spiritually close to something or someone and that this said want and desire is unconstrained by the wants and rules that govern survival. The life choices that are made in the pursuit of love, exponentially reduces your chance of survival in this world. That’s really the basics of a definition that I could give you.</description>
