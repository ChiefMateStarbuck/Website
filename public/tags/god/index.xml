      <description>And as god fell one piece a time, through the ashed gray, he called out to the child for help. And for all the suffering that was given to the child, after all the lost loves that was burdened through his ever growing days, the child reached out and saved god from his own tragedies. And god grabbed back with ever growing force, reluctant to ever look into his saviorâ€™s eyes again.</description>

      <description>I held tightly to the belief that I would one day be a god. I awaited for it, praised its coming, even went so far as to dream for it. I realize now that it is a curse, and a great sadness arises from its coming.
I am glad that I am only human. I am glad that my days are numbered because it makes every day count more; it puts an energy into all that I do for I know that nothing is infinite.</description>
