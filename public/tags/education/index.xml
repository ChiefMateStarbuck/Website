      <description>Before I begin, please do not misinterpret me: I do not care for the life of every individual that comprises the Florida Atlantic Student body. To be very clear, when I look around me and see only dilapidated and demotivated faces, my first thought is not to help every single one I see, but to analyze why they feel the way they do and to avoid the cause of their suffering at all costs.</description>

      <description>As the new fall semester begins, so to does the yearly drudge and tiring exhalations of students and faculty heard through out the halls like background noise to a horror film. It is not pretty. The pursuit of pure knowledge, degrees, and ultimately a higher position in society were never designed to be an aesthetically pleasing journey.
But this is fall. I am about to begin the final year of a four year journey and in a few short months, receive a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (hopefully with honors if nothing to dramatically terrible happens to my GPA) and begin my career in the tech field.</description>
